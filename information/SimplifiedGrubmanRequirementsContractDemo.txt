Grubman Contract Assistant - Requirements Document
Version: 1.0 (Simplified for 4-Day Delivery)
Date: October 14, 2025
Client: Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks
Delivery Date: October 18, 2025 (Demo Ready)
Demo Duration: 30 minutes with Larry Shire

1. Executive Summary
1.1 Project Goal
Build a working AI-powered contract assistant that demonstrates two critical capabilities for Grubman's transactional law practice:
1. Smart Contract Drafting - Generate NDAs and contracts using firm history and previous agreements
2. Automated Due Diligence - Review contracts against Eric Sacks' due diligence checklist
1.2 Strategic Context
* Grubman is evaluating NetDocs AI, Spellbook AI, and Harvey AI
* They are a transactional law firm (entertainment, contracts, deals - NOT litigation)
* Partners are attracted to polished, working demos
* Larry Shire (key decision-maker) wants a 30-minute comparison demo
* Timeline is NON-NEGOTIABLE: Must demo by October 18, 2025
1.3 Success Criteria (Must Have)
* ? Demo runs without errors during 30-minute presentation
* ? Shows clear time savings over manual processes
* ? Demonstrates firm-specific learning (uses client history)
* ? Addresses Eric Sacks' due diligence requirements
* ? Professional UI that compares favorably to competitors
* ? Larry Shire says "impressive" and requests follow-up meeting
1.4 Out of Scope (Phase 2)
* ? NetDocs integration (will be Phase 2)
* ? Patent-protected features (parallel processing, statistical bounds, etc.)
* ? Multi-agent orchestration (unnecessary complexity for demo)
* ? Cryptographic audit trails (Phase 2)
* ? Conflict detection across all client obligations (Phase 2)
2. Core Use Cases (FOCUS)
2.1 Use Case #1: Contract Drafting from Firm History

4.2 Scenario 2: Due Diligence Review (15 minutes)
Setup:
 User: Eric Sacks (or attorney on his team)
 Document: 45-page vendor services agreement
 Task: Quick due diligence before client meeting
Demo Flow:
 Attorney opens "Review Contract" tab
 Uploads vendor agreement PDF
 System analyzes for 90 seconds (shows progress bar)
 Results appear: 
 Overall Risk Score: 0.67 (HIGH)
 Checklist Dashboard: 7/10 green, 2 yellow, 1 red

 Market standard alternative
 Suggested redline
 Attorney generates full PDF report (30 seconds)
 Downloads report for client
Key Message: "What used to take 3 hours now takes 5 minutes. Nothing gets missed - Eric's checklist is automated. You can focus on strategy, not searching for needles in 45-page haystacks."

5. Competitive Differentiation
5.1 vs. NetDocs AI
Our Advantages:
 Standalone system (not tied to NetDocs) (Will be integrated)
 Firm-specific learning (gets smarter with every use)
 Customizable checklist (Eric Sacks' actual process)
Demo Message: "NetDocs is great for document management, but it doesn't learn YOUR firm's preferences. We do." - Compliments and get more value from NetDocs investment
5.2 vs. Spellbook AI
Our Advantages:
 Works with any format (not limited to Word) (Start with txt, pdf, docx)
 Integrates firm history (Spellbook doesn't)
 Customizable due diligence (Spellbook is generic)
Demo Message: "Spellbook is impressive for general drafting, but it doesn't know Grubman. We learn from every contract you've ever done."
5.3 vs. Harvey AI
Our Advantages:
 Built for transactional law (Harvey is litigation-focused)
 Faster drafting (Harvey is research-heavy)
 Client history integration (Harvey doesn't have this)
Demo Message: "Harvey is excellent for research and litigation. We're built specifically for what YOU do: transactional work and due diligence."
6. Implementation Phases
6.1 4-Day Sprint Breakdown
Day 1: Setup & Foundation
 Clone ContractIQ from GitHub
 Install dependencies

 Can you provide 2-3 sample Grubman contracts (redacted)?
 If not, we'll create realistic synthetic versions
 What industries should we focus on? (music, film, sports?)
 Branding Assets
 Do you have logo files (PNG/SVG)?
 What are official brand colors?
 If not available, we'll use placeholder
 Demo Logistics
 Confirmed date/time: October 18, 2025?
 Who will attend besides Larry Shire?
 Will this be in-person or virtual?
 Do you have reliable WiFi at location?
 Scope Confirmation
 Are the two use cases (drafting + DD) sufficient for demo?
 Any other features Larry Shire specifically wants to see?
 Is 30-minute demo the right duration?

Appendix A: Why This Scope is Achievable in 4 Days
What we're NOT building in Phase 1 (saves 2+ weeks):
 ? Vector database / semantic search (simple keyword matching is fine)
 ? Numeric risk scoring algorithms (0.0-1.0) - just flag Critical/High/Medium
 ? Visual dashboards with charts (text-based reports are fine)
 ? Advanced highlighting systems (green/yellow/red) - basic sections are fine
 ? Clause provenance tracking - not needed for demo
 ? Multi-agent orchestration (unnecessary complexity)
 ? Patent-protected algorithms (Phase 2)
 ? NetDocs integration (Phase 2)
 ? Custom LLM fine-tuning (use GPT-4 or other LLM as-is)
 ? Professional PDF generation with formatting (simple text/DOCX is fine)
 ? Market comparison data (requires external data sources)
What we ARE building (minimal viable demo):
 ? Simple Streamlit UI with 2 tabs (We made use other framework after testing)
 ? Template-based contract generation with GPT-4 or other simple LLM
 ? Basic firm history matching (keyword/industry)
 ? Checklist-based due diligence review
 ? Critical issue flagging (pattern matching)
 ? Basic text report output
 ? Professional appearance and branding
Realistic Timeline:
 Day 1: Setup + Template Creation + Basic UI (6-8 hours)
 Day 2: Contract Drafting (simple GPT-4 prompts) (8 hours)
 Day 3: Due Diligence (pattern matching + GPT-4) (8 hours)
 Day 4: Polish + Practice (6-8 hours)
 Total: 28-32 hours of focused work
This is DOABLE because:
 We're building from scratch with simple architecture (no complex dependencies)
 Using only proven, simple technologies (Streamlit + GPT-4 + basic Python)
 Scope is limited to 2 use cases with simplified features
 No integration with external systems
 No vector databases or semantic search complexity
 Demo quality, not production quality
 Leveraging GPT-4's  or other LLM intelligence instead of building complex algorithms
