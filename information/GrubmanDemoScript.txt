Grubman provide the following 4 files
1.  Simple Deal (Producer Short Form - Drake/Metro Boomin)
2. Mid-Complexity Deal (Management Agreement - Billie Eilish)
3. High-Stakes Deal (Producer Long Form - Comprehensive)
We will convert them to text documents for this demonstration. Note we are not using a vector database is why.

What we plan to achieve
* Shows AI adaptability across complexity levels
* Demonstrates range from quick deals to major transactions
* Proves the system scales with deal sophistication

DEMO SETUP

1. Simple/Quick Deal
2. Standard/Mid-Complexity  
3. Comprehensive/High-Stakes

Intent - Makes the "intelligence" visible to Larry Shire.

##  DEMO SCRIPT - THREE Items

*"Good morning. I'm here to show you how Airiam AI can transform Grubman's contract practice - using YOUR firm's actual work, at every complexity level."*

*"This system learned from three real Grubman contracts - and this is strategic:"*

1. *"Your **Drake/Metro Boomin production deal** - quick, streamlined, 13 pages"*
2. *"Your **Billie Eilish management agreement** - mid-complexity, 21 pages with sunset provisions"*
3. *"Your **comprehensive producer template** - high-stakes, 50+ pages with four exhibits"*

*"Why three? Because you don't use the same level of detail for every deal."*

*"A simple single production? **Quick turnaround**."*  
*"Artist representation? **Standard protections**."*  
*"Pharrell producing for Beyoncé? **Every bell and whistle**."*

*"In the next 20 minutes, you'll see the AI **adapt to all three complexity levels** - Demonstrating how it understands context, not just templates."*


*"Let's start simple and build up."*

## Demo step 1: SIMPLE PRODUCTION DEAL (5 minutes)

DEMO APPROACH #1: The "Draft Similar" Demo

### **Scenario: Generate New Producer Agreement**

**Setup Story:**
"We just signed a new up-and-coming producer - let's call her Taylor Martinez. 
She's working with one of our music clients. We need a producer agreement 
similar to the one we did for Metro Boomin and Drake. Watch how the AI 
uses our firm history..."

### **Live Demo Steps:**

**1. Open Tab 1: Draft Contract**

Click " Draft Contract" tab


**2. Enter the Details:**

Contract Type: Service Agreement
Client Name: Taylor Martinez
Industry: Music
First Party: Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks, P.C.
Second Party: Taylor Martinez Productions
Term Duration: three years
Business Purpose: Production services for master recordings featuring 
                  artist's performances, including royalty and rights management
```

**3. Click Generate ( 20-30 seconds):**

"The system is now:
- Searching our firm history for similar music production agreements
- Finding the Producer Agreement we did for Metro Boomin and Drake
- Extracting key clauses like royalty structure, work-for-hire provisions
- Generating a complete new agreement using Private Airiam AI
- Maintaining Grubman's language and style throughout"


**4. When Result Appears:**

Point out:
? "See - it found the Brain Trust Producer Agreement from 2021"
? "Notice the royalty structure - it's following our standard terms"
? "Look at the work-for-hire language - authentic Grubman style"
? "The sample clearance provisions - directly from our real contracts"
? "California jurisdiction, Los Angeles venue - exactly like we always do"


**5. Show the Draft:**

Scroll through and highlight:
- Professional formatting
- Complete sections (not placeholders)
- Real legal terminology
- Grubman-specific clauses
- References to Republic Records/UMG (shows it learned from real contracts)


**6. The Wow Moment:**

"What traditionally took 45 minutes of attorney time - searching through 
old contracts, copying clauses, adapting terms - just happened in less than a minute.

And it's learning from YOUR actual agreements - the Producer Agreement you 
use with artists like Drake, Metro Boomin, and others. This maintains your 
firm standards automatically."


*"But what if the deal is more complex? What if it's not just a one-off production, but ongoing artist representation?"*

*"Let me show you..."*


## **Step 2: MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT REVIEW (8 minutes)**

**YOU SAY:**

*"New scenario: An emerging artist received a management agreement offer."*

**[NEW - Add this comparison]**

*"Management agreements are **different animals** from production deals:"*
- *"Longer relationships - 4+ years vs. per-project"*
- *"More complex compensation - sunset provisions, commission exclusions"*
- *"Ongoing fiduciary duties - not just work-for-hire"*

*"Your Billie Eilish management template reflects that - **mid-complexity, 21 pages**."*

*"Let's see if the AI catches issues by comparing against YOUR management standard..."*

DEMO APPROACH #2: The "Review Risky Terms" Demo

### **Scenario: Review Incoming Management Agreement**

**Setup Story:**
"A prospective client sent us their existing management agreement. They want 
to know if they're getting a fair deal. Let's run it through our due diligence 
system - we'll compare it against our standard Management Agreement to spot 
any problematic terms..."

### **Live Demo Steps:**

**1. Upload the Real Contract**

**Option A - Use the actual Management Agreement:**

Click "Review Contract" tab
Upload: management_agreement_artist_2022.txt
Click "Analyze Contract"

**Option B - Create a "Bad" Version with Red Flags:**

Before demo, create: bad_management_agreement.txt
Add problematic terms:
- 30% commission (vs standard 20%)
- No sunset provisions
- Perpetual term with auto-renewal
- One-sided termination rights
- Unlimited liability for artist
- No commission exclusions

**2. Talk While Analyzing (90 seconds):**

"The system is now:
- Extracting all text from the contract
- Running pattern matching against our risk database
- Checking Eric Sacks' due diligence checklist
- Comparing terms to industry standards
- Using AI to analyze each major clause category
- Generating a comprehensive risk report"

**3. When Results Appear:**

**If using GOOD contract (real one):**

? "Overall Risk: LOW - this is actually very well-balanced"
? "20% commission rate - industry standard"
? "Sunset provisions included - protects artist after term"
? "Mutual indemnification - fair to both sides"
? "JAMS arbitration - professional dispute resolution"
? "Reasonable expense caps - $250/$1000 limits"

"This is a solid agreement - actually very similar to OUR standard 
Management Agreement. The artist is getting fair terms."


**If using BAD contract:**
```
?? "30% commission rate - 50% higher than industry standard (20%)"
?? "No sunset provisions - artist pays forever even after term ends"
?? "Unlimited liability for artist - massive financial exposure"
?? "One-sided termination - manager can leave anytime, artist can't"
?? "No commission exclusions - artist pays on recording costs, tour expenses"

"This agreement has serious problems. Let me show you the specific issues..."

**4. Click Through Top Concerns:**
"Let's look at the top 3 issues in detail:

Issue #1: Excessive Commission Rate
- Found: '30% of all Gross Monies'
- Problem: Industry standard is 20%, this is 50% higher
- Recommendation: Negotiate down to 20% or justify the premium

Issue #2: No Sunset Provisions  
- Found: 'commissions payable in perpetuity'
- Problem: Artist pays forever even after relationship ends
- Recommendation: Add declining sunset - 100%, 75%, 50%, 50% over 4 years

Issue #3: Unlimited Artist Liability
- Found: 'Artist shall indemnify Manager from any and all claims'
- Problem: No cap on liability exposure
- Recommendation: Add reasonable caps tied to commissions received"

**6. The Wow Moment:**
"Eric Sacks' entire due diligence process - the checklist he's refined over 
decades - is now automated. What used to take 3 hours of careful review 
just happened in 90 seconds.

And because we trained it on YOUR actual contracts - like the Management 
Agreement we use - it knows what Grubman-quality terms look like. It's 
comparing this against YOUR standards, not generic benchmarks."MAY not use the following?????
### **Enhanced Issue #2 Presentation:**

**[After showing Missing Sunset Provisions]**

**YOU SAY:**

*"Now here's where it gets really sophisticated."*

*"The AI didn't just find a missing clause. It understood **CONTEXT**."*

*"It knew we're reviewing a **management agreement** - so it compared against your **Billie Eilish management template**, not your producer templates."*

*"If this were a production deal, sunset provisions wouldn't matter - those are per-project."*

*"But for management? **Absolutely critical**. The AI understood the difference."*

*"That's not pattern matching. That's **contextual intelligence**."*



*"Now... what about the **really complex deals**?"*

*"The Pharrell-for-Beyoncé level. The multi-million dollar album productions. The ones where EVERYTHING has to be bulletproof."*

Let me show you how the AI handles - maximum complexity



## **Step 3: COMPREHENSIVE ALBUM PRODUCTION (6 minutes)**

**[Click back to Tab 1: Draft Contract]**

**YOU SAY:**

*"Final scenario - and this is where it gets impressive."*

*"One of your A-list clients just hired a major producer for their next album."*

**[Slow down - make this dramatic]**

1. *"**Multi-million dollar budget** - every dollar matters"*
2. *"**Complex tiered royalties** - USNRC, international, budget, video, all different rates"*
3. *"**Sample clearance** - one mistake costs millions in lawsuits"*
4. *"**Publishing splits** - multiple writers, ownership percentages"*
5. *"**Security protocols** - leaks can kill a $50M album launch"*
6. *"**Four separate exhibits** - Letters of Direction, Controlled Compositions, Sampling Forms, SoundExchange"*

*"This is the contract where if you miss **ONE clause**, your client loses millions or faces years of litigation."*

*"This is where you need *maximum protection** - your **50+ page comprehensive template**."*

*"Watch the AI recognize that..."*
